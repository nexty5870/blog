## Thingiverse is slowwwww!

Right since fews months various user including myself has been reporting Thingiverse is slow, and that because they been adding some backend resulting in having the website acting really slow! Don't you worry I've got you covered!

## Solution

This new backend they been installing is called New Relic, in order to get Thingiverse great again, we will block this script and this is super easy.

I'm using Chrome, but the plugin is also available on Firefox. The plugin name is: [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/) and this make your browser smarter, allowing you to see what's is running on the website you're visiting

Right so once you're plugin is installed ( super easy just go to the chrome app store or on the Ghostery website ) and install it

All you have to do once installed, is hit to [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com) Open Ghostery, Detailed View and disable New Relic

**and Tadaaaaa, reload thingiverse and you will probably notice some improvement.**

I've seen this on a Redditt comment late last night - I apologize I cannot remember the User who posted about New-Relic backend, but it's worth mentionning, thanks Mr.!
