**Note:** This project is undergoing.

The Nanoleaf clone project would be the first project to be on the blog,if you don't know what the Nanoleaf is, I'll recommand you clicking on that [link](https://nanoleaf.me/en/)

Pretty good connected devices that can add some atmosphere to your rooms, down side is that it's fairly expensive ( the design is worth it )

I've came across this thing link [thing:3230905](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3230905) and I though it's a pretty good idea for Xmas!

I had some Led and NodeMCU available and decided to take onboard on the project. I'm still having some pannel that currently printing ( I'm doing a 20 triangle panel size )

_Stay tunned on the next update!_
