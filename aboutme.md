My name is Quentin Daems. I'm a **enthousiast** maker:

- I ❤️ 3D printing!
- I 🛠️ Making stuff!
- I 💻 Coding & electronics


I'm also launching this blog and resuming my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/nexty5870), make sure you subscribe there!

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [last video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avAvKLBAA-U) and it will answer **all** your questions.
